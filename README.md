# panopoly_project
A Composer-based installer for the Panopoly distribution of Drupal 8.

Get Started

$ composer create-project W4U-TOURS/panopoly_project MY_PROJECT

Composer will create a new directory called MY_PROJECT containing a docroot directory with a full Panopoly code base therein. You can then install it like you would any other Drupal site.
